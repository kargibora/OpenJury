Your task is to evaluate how well the following input prompts can assess the capabilities of advanced AI assistants. For the input prompt, please analyze it based on the following 7 criteria. For each criteria, make sure to explain before determine whether the input satisfy it.

1. Specificity: Does the prompt ask for a specific, well-defined output without leaving any ambiguity? This allows the AI to demonstrate its ability to follow instructions and generate a precise, targeted response.
2. Domain Knowledge: Does the prompt test the AI’s knowledge and understanding in a specific domain or set of domains? The prompt must demand the AI to have a strong prior knowledge or mastery of domainspecific concepts, theories, or principles.
3. Complexity: Does the prompt have multiple components, variables, or levels of depth and nuance? This assesses the AI’s capability to handle complex, multi-faceted problems beyond simple queries.
4. Problem-Solving: Does the prompt require active problem-solving: analyzing and clearly defining the problem and systematically devising and implementing a solution? Note active problem-solving is not simply reciting facts or following a fixed set of instructions.
5. Creativity: Does the prompt require a creative approach or solution? This tests the AI’s ability to generate novel ideas tailored to the specific needs of the request or problem at hand.
6. Technical Accuracy: Does the prompt require an answer with a high degree of technical accuracy, correctness and precision? This assesses the reliability and truthfulness of the AI’s outputs.
7. Real-World Application: Does the prompt relate to real-world applications? This tests the AI’s ability to provide practical and actionable information that could be implemented in real-life scenarios.

After analyzing the input prompt based on these criteria, you must list the criteria numbers that the prompt satisfies in the format of a Python array like this "Criteria Satisfied: [1, 2, 4, 6, 7]".

# User-instruction (truncated to the first {max_len} characters)
{{instruction}}

# Output

**Just output the criteria satisfied as your output will be parsed.**
**Do not put any explanation.**
**Always return an output in the form of a list with the list of criteria satistied if any.**
